(intro: 5 min)
1. who are you and what the hell are you doing to my terminals?
 - why notcurses? are you autistic, or just not very smart?

You might expect that I am a graphics programmer, or perhaps even a front-end
developer. Nah, HPC, big networking, and compilers. This was a lark, resulting
from Thomas Dickey rejecting a few blingy patches.

2. problems with Curses
 - multithreaded support is lacking
 - no EGC support
 - no RGB
3. problems with Curses replacements
 - most are not in C
 - no multimedia hooks (libtickit)
 - Sixel is rarely supported
4. notcurses model
 - one standard plane matching rendering area
 - z-axis of rectilinear planes of arbitrary size
 - each cell has EGC, styling, and channels
 - only ascii or utf8
 - color blending
5. current terminals
 - alacritty: not in debian, not sure about fonts, emoji
 - kitty: some problems with unexpected transparency
 - skinnings of vte
 - font/fontrenderingengine pain point
6. future directions
 - better reflow
 - palettepusher
 - improved painter's algorithm
 - become a terminal, pty-in-a-pty, rebuilt screen in notcurses

(demo: 10 min)
0. show nesticle+notcurses; the fly honeys luv it
1. let's make Debian Warrior!
 - grab media
    * map of final fantasy i overworld
    * Celes character sprites
    * picture of Balsac the Jaws of Death
 - find offset of starting place
 - math of pixel <> cell conversion
2. create a context and add our character
 - notcurses_init()
 - ask for character's name
 - load sprite in each form
 - move each offscreen
 - timerfd() epoll loop switches between planes
 - bring new one onscreen, move current offscreen
 - subbox with hp, mp, level
3. load up background
 - load background onto giant plane
 - localize plane properly
4. handle input
 - add input fd to epoll(), direct to handler
 - arrow keys and vi keys move character around on map
5. contact with an enemy!
 - after some number of steps, we contact an enemy
 - bring up plane with image inside
 - throw plane beneath this, 2 rows + cols bigger, throw on border
 - throw up battle plane with scrolling
 - throw up action selector
6. intro screen
 - rotating debian logo atop the word WARRIOR
 - screen fade into part #1
